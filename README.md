Handy tools created for peronal use for myself, but I tought to share them

1. <a href="https://github.com/gergogyulai/minitools/blob/main/tmdb-scraper.js">TMDb Image Scraper<a/>
    Intended to scrape TMDB (themoviedb.org) images right from your browser.
    Works with the following locations on the site:
     - themoviedb.org/movie/872585-oppenheimer<b>/images/posters</b>
     - themoviedb.org/movie/872585-oppenheimer<b>/images/logos</b>
     - themoviedb.org/movie/872585-oppenheimer<b>/images/backdrops</b>
    It downloads a singular zip file with all the images from the page you run it on
